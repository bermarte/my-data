## You can always count on me

On odd days (on days that are even numbers) I can teach you Blender.

## A funny story

My dog ​​has (almost) the same name as me, it's not so funny but it's something curious. I was told so once I got it for the first name, to convince me to adopt it, I think. So it's called Berny and Berny was also my nickname.

### TL;DR
Hi, I am Bernardo and my dog is Berny.
